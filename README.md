# LCD
This is a fork of https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/lcd, i only added lcdshow.py that implements som functions as blink and center.

-f  <message to display on first row>

 -s  <message to display on second row> 

 -b <blink first row> 

-B <blink second row> 

-c <center first row> 

-C <center second row>
